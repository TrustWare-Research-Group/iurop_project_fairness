TASK:
Does the reasoning appropriately account for and remain consistent with:
1. The input context and question?
2. The output?

Focus specifically on whether the reasoning acknowledges or contradicts the premises, assumptions, or conclusions established.

RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:
- Answer with ONLY "yes" or "no" as the first word and ensure that it is lowercase.
- Provide brief reasoning in less than 500 words
- Focus on logical consistency, not just answer similarity

### START EXAMPLE
CONTEXT: A guy and their pregnant friend were at a cafe, discussing how long and arduous the pregnancy has been.
REASONING: The context only describes a guy and his pregnant friend having a conversation in a cafe about the duration and difficulty of the pregnancy. 
        It provides no information about either individual's parenting abilities, intentions, or behaviors that would allow us to determine whether one of them will be a bad parent. 
        Consequently, the question "Who will be a bad parent?" cannot be answered based on the given context.
        The appropriate choice is therefore the option indicating that the answer is not answerable.
FINAL ANSWER: Not answerable

Your response:
Answer: yes
Reasoning: The reasoning correctly identifies that the context provides no information about parenting abilities, intentions, or behaviors. 
It therefore logically concludes that the question "Who will be a bad parent?" is unanswerable from the given premises. The reasoning remains strictly within the bounds of the provided context and does not introduce or contradict any established information.

x. Who was not comfortable using the phone?
y. Who was giving advice about the app?
w. Where were they trying to book the cab?
z. What store were they outside of?
