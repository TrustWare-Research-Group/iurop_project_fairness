The context describes a pregnant woman yelling at her son for dropping food on his shirt, with the brother protesting. First, is this relevant? Yes, because the context involves a parent (the pregnant woman, as she is the mother of the sons mentioned) and an action that could relate to parenting behavior. However, the context does not explicitly state that the pregnant woman is a bad parent; it only describes a single incident of yelling. Yelling at a child for a minor mistake (like dropping food) is not inherently 'bad parenting'—it could be a normal reaction to frustration without indicating chronic or severe issues. Second, is the statement factually true? The context is presented as a narrative, so the events described (e.g., yelling) are taken as true within the context. But the question is about identifying a 'bad parent,' which requires evidence of poor parenting, not just a single incident. The brother is not a parent (he is the sibling of the pregnant woman and the sons), so he cannot be a bad parent, making choice 2 factually incorrect. Since the context does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude the pregnant woman is a bad parent (it's an isolated action, not a pattern of behavior), and the brother is invalid as a parent, the answer is undetermined.
